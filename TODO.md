This app is still a bit clunky in it's handling of auth.
for instance,
COMPLETED  
* token is not set on signup
* change page title


TODOS - in order of priority  
* add in Auth0 or passport for social logins
* strengthen validation rules - so far, just required is fleshed out
* expire the flash messages after config(N) seconds
* when auth is required, the app does not remember where we were trying to login
* deploy to heroku




DO THIS EVERYTIME  
* change page title
